## Description
code refactoring is the process of editing and cleaning up previously written code
without changing the intended function of the code itself. the purpose of this is
to make subsequent maintenence of the code more efficient. specifically, this is done by making the code more readable (adding cohesiveness to the overall code structure) and the quality analysis and/or debugging process less convoluted.
